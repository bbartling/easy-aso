# Easy ASO ü§ñ
Welcome to Easy ASO, the ultimate command tool for Automated Supervisory Optimization (ASO) of BACnet systems. 
Much like commanding units in a strategy game, Easy ASO puts you at the helm of your building systems, empowering you to optimize performance, reduce energy consumption, and maintain comfort with ease.

With intuitive controls and streamlined BACnet property reads and writes, Easy ASO is your base of operations. 
By automating complex routines, you can deploy your control strategies with precision and efficiency, much like bot scripting in gaming industry. 
The best part? The battle for energy efficiency doesn't require long scripts‚Äîbasic sexamples are always under 100 lines of code!

## The Skeleton of Every Great Bot
Every bot you create to control BACnet systems follows this simple `on_start` and `on_step` structure, ready to deploy your strategy in real-time very inspired by the [StarCraft II API Client for Python 3](https://github.com/BurnySc2/python-sc2):

```python
class CustomHvacBot(EasyASO):
    async def on_start(self):
        # Custom start logic - BACnet read request
	sensor = await self.bacnet_read(BACNET_ADDR, BACNET_OBJ_ID)
        print("CustomBot is deploying! Read in some value")

    async def on_step(self):
        # Custom step logic - BACnet write request
	sensor_value_best = sensor + 5.0
	await self.bacnet_write(BACNET_ADDR, BACNET_OBJ_ID, sensor_value_best)
        print("Executing step actions... The system is being optimized!")
        await asyncio.sleep(60)

    async def on_stop(self):
        # Custom stop logic - BACnet release request
	await self.bacnet_write(BACNET_ADDR, BACNET_OBJ_ID, 'null')
        print("Executing stop actions... The system is released back to normal!")

# main.py
async def main():
    bot = CustomBot()
    await bot.run()  # Automatically manages on_start, on_step, and on_stop, just like SC2!
```

## Schematics: 

Easy-aso always operates behind the firewall and can operate with an IoT integration to the building systems.
![Schematic of Python script deployment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bbartling/easy-aso/develop/new_building.png)

Easy-aso can also operate just fine without an IoT integration to the building systems which would just be traditional operations (OT) technology systems that do not have access to the internet.

## Getting Started with easy-aso
Follow the instructions below to set up the `easy-aso` project on your local Linux machine. Until the project is available on PyPI, you can install it locally by following these steps. 
After the scripts are thoroughly tested and commissioned, they can be run long-term in a Docker container. 
See the sub directory `docker_setup` for more information.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
First, clone the `easy-aso` repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bbartling/easy-aso
```
### Step 2: Install the Package Locally
Navigate into the project directory and install it using `pip`. This will make the `easy-aso` package available in your Python environment.
```bash
cd easy-aso
pip install .
```

## Cybersecurity Disclaimer

Easy ASO is designed as an operations technology (OT) application with no built-in cloud connectivity but it is fully capable of anything programmed in Python. Any implementation of cloud connectivity for this app is the responsibility of the user. It is crucial to understand the cybersecurity implications of sending bi-directional signals to building systems.

**Security Best Practices**:
- Ensure the safety of your systems by following recommended cybersecurity best practices, including network, VPN, and VM access hardening, secure configurations, and routine security checks.
- Work closely with the IT team when enabling cloud connectivity to ensure it complies with your organization's security policies.
- Involve IT in all stages of the project and address any issues related to the implementation of easy-aso.
- Safeguard building control systems by utilizing access controls, encryption, and secure communication protocols to prevent unauthorized access.
- Act in the capacity of an ICS security specialist on behalf of your client, and promptly report any vulnerabilities or issues you discover.
- Develop an incident response plan to ensure the project is prepared for any potential security breaches, enabling swift and effective action from the incident response team should an issue arise during the implementation of easy-aso.

## Contributing:

PR, git issues, or discussions encouraged! Requirements are the app must be easy, configurable, and not complex.

By incorporating these changes, your README will provide a more comprehensive overview of the easy-aso project and help users understand its purpose and how they can contribute or use it.

## Contributing:

PRs, git issues, and discussions are highly encouraged! The requirements for contributions are that the app remains easy to use, configurable, and avoids unnecessary complexity.

Currently, the project includes two unit tests:

1. **Abstract Base Class (ABC) Validation:**: This test ensures that the EasyASO abstract base class is functioning as intended. Specifically, it verifies that any EasyASO application implements the required methods: on_start, on_stop, and on_step.

2. **BACnet Integration Test:** This test sets up a sample EasyASO client application and a simulated BACnet server device, both running in Docker containers. The test verifies that these applications can successfully communicate over the BACnet protocol. If the client and server can exchange data as expected, the test passes.

### Development Setup:

To get started with development, you'll need to:

1. **Local pip install**: Develop in a local Python package environment.
   ```bash
   pip uninstall easy-aso
   pip install .
   ```

2. **Setup Docker**: 
    Since the project relies on Docker and Docker Compose to simulate BACnet environments for testing, it's important to ensure these tools are properly installed. Simply follow the instructions in the `easy-aso/docker_setup` directory. These will guide you through setting up Docker and Docker Compose so you can run the necessary tests seamlessly.

3. **Run tests**: 
    With everything in place, you can verify your setup by running the test suite. Use the following command to run unit tests, including those that interact with the BACnet simulation:
    ```bash
    pytest
    ```
    The tests will check that everything works as expected and that your development environment is configured correctly.
